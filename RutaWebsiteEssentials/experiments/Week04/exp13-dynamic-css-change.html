                    Tom and Jerry is an American animated series of short films created in 1940 by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera.
                    It centers on a rivalry between its two main characters, Tom Cat and Jerry Mouse, and many recurring characters,
                    based around slapstick comedy.
                    In its original run, Hanna and Barbera produced 114 Tom and Jerry shorts for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer from 1940 to 1957.
                    During this time, they won seven Academy Awards for Animated Short Film, tying for first place with Walt Disney's
                    Silly Symphonies with the most awards in the category. After the MGM cartoon studio closed in 1957, MGM revived the
                    series with Gene Deitch directing an additional 13 Tom and Jerry shorts for Rembrandt Films from 1960 to 1962.
                    Tom and Jerry then became the highest-grossing animated short film series of that time, overtaking Looney Tunes.
                    Chuck Jones then produced another 34 shorts with Sib-Tower 12 Productions between 1963 and 1967.
                    Two more shorts were produced, The Mansion Cat in 2001 and The Karate Guard in 2005, for a total of 163 shorts.
                    Various shorts have been released for home media since the 1990s.

                    The Flintstones is an animated, prime-time American television sitcom that was broadcast from September 30, 1960,
                    to April 1, 1966, on ABC. The show was produced by Hanna-Barbera. The Flintstones was about a working-class Stone
                    Age man's life with his family and his next-door neighbor and best friend.
                    The show's continuing popularity rested heavily on its juxtaposition of modern everyday concerns in the Stone Age
                    setting. The Flintstones was the most financially successful network animated franchise for three decades,
                    until The Simpsons debuted.
                    The show is set in the Stone Age town of Bedrock. In this fantasy version of the past, dinosaurs, saber-toothed
                    cats, woolly mammoths, and other long-extinct animals co-exist with cavemen. Like their mid-20th century
                    counterparts, these cavemen listen to records, live in split-level homes, and eat out at restaurants, yet their
                    technology is made entirely from pre-industrial materials and largely powered through the use of animals.
                    For example, the cars are made out of stone, wood, and animal skins, and powered by the passengers' feet.

    <h3>Experiment Description</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
        This experiment uses jQuery addClass() and removeClass() to change the CSS dynamically.
        The addClass() method does not remove existing class attributes, it only adds one or more class names to the class
        attribute.
        The remove() method removes the selected element. It also accepts one parameter, which allows you to filter the 
        elements to be removed.
