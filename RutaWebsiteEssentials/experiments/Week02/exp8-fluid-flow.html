                From the late 18th century through the 19th century, the market for printed books and domestic art
                contributed substantially to the growth of the medium. Watercolors were the used as the basic document
                from which collectible landscape or tourist engravings were developed, and handpainted watercolor originals
                or copies of famous paintings contributed to many upper class art portfolios.

            <h3 class="center">Oil Paintings</h3>
            <p>
                Although oil paint was first used for the Buddhist paintings by Indian and Chinese painters in
                western Afghanistan sometime between the fifth and tenth centuries, it did not gain popularity
                until the 15th century.

            <p>
                The transition began with Early Netherlandish painting in Northern Europe
                and by the height of the Renaissance oil painting techniques had almost completely replaced
                tempera paints in the majority of Europe.

            <h3 class="center">Acryllic Paintings</h3>
            <p>
                Compared to oil and watercolor, acrylic painting is a relatively modern medium for artistic expression.
                The history of oil painting extends far back in Western history and watercolor has its roots in the
                Renaissance, whereas acrylic has only just emerged over the course of the past century. As with watercolor
                and oil, acrylic offers its own distinct set of characteristics and attributes, most notably its versatility,
                immediacy, and durability. Many artists are attracted to acrylic painting for its dominant bright colors and
                sharp brushstrokes.

        <h3>Experiment Description</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
            This is an experiment about sliding divs.
            On hovering over "About Watercolor painting", a sliding div appears which contains information about
            Watercolor painting. The effect is acheived using CSS transitions and slideToggle() function in jQuery.
