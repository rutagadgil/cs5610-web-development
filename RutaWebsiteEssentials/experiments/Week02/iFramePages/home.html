        Indian painting has a very long tradition and history in Indian art. 
        The earliest Indian paintings were the rock paintings of pre-historic times, the petroglyphs as found in
        places like Bhimbetka rock shelters, some of the Stone Age rock paintings found among the Bhimbetka rock
        shelters are approximately 30,000 years old. India's Buddhist literature is replete with examples of texts
        which describe palaces of the army and the aristocratic class embellished with paintings, but the paintings of 
        the Ajanta Caves are the most significant of the few survivals. Smaller scale painting in manuscripts was probably
        also practised in this period, though the earliest survivals are from the medieval period. Mughal painting
        represented a fusion of the Persian miniature with older Indian traditions, and from the 17th century its
        style was diffused across Indian princely courts of all religions, each developing a local style. 
        Company paintings were made for British clients under the British raj, which from the 19th century also introduced
        art schools along Western lines, leading to modern Indian painting, which is increasingly returning to its Indian
        routes.
