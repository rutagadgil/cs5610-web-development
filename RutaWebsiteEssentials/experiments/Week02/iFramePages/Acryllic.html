            Compared to oil and watercolor, acrylic painting is a relatively modern medium for artistic expression.
            The history of oil painting extends far back in Western history and watercolor has its roots in the
            Renaissance, whereas acrylic has only just emerged over the course of the past century. As with watercolor
            and oil, acrylic offers its own distinct set of characteristics and attributes, most notably its versatility,
            immediacy, and durability. Many artists are attracted to acrylic painting for its dominant bright colors and
            sharp brushstrokes and lines, as well as for the paint’s capacity to be used on a variety of surfaces and 
            mixed with a multitude of other media. All in all, acrylic painting offers the artist a wide range of
            approaches, providing a wealth of creative potential for artistic innovation and fresh new ideas.
