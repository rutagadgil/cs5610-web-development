    <h3>Oil Painting</h3>

        <p>
            Although oil paint was first used for the Buddhist paintings by Indian and Chinese painters in
            western Afghanistan sometime between the fifth and tenth centuries, it did not gain popularity
            until the 15th century. Its practice may have migrated westward during the Middle Ages.
            Oil paint eventually became the principal medium used for creating artworks as its advantages
            became widely known. The transition began with Early Netherlandish painting in Northern Europe
            and by the height of the Renaissance oil painting techniques had almost completely replaced
            tempera paints in the majority of Europe.
