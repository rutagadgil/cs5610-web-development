        <p>
            From the late 18th century through the 19th century, the market for printed books and domestic art
            contributed substantially to the growth of the medium. Watercolors were the used as the basic document
            from which collectible landscape or tourist engravings were developed, and handpainted watercolor originals
            or copies of famous paintings contributed to many upper class art portfolios. Satirical broadsides by Thomas
            Rowlandson, many published by Rudolph Ackermann, were also extremely popular.
