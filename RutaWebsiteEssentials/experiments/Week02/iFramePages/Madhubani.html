            Madhubani painting originated in a small village, known as Maithili,
            of the Bihar state of India. Initially, the womenfolk of the village
            drew the paintings on the walls of their home, as an illustration of
            their thoughts, hopes and dreams. With time, the paintings started
            becoming a part of festivities and special events, like marriage.
