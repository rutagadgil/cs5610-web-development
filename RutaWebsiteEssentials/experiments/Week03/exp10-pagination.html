                    Watercolor painting has the reputation of being quite demanding; 
                    it is more accurate to say that watercolor techniques are unique to watercolor.
                    Unlike oil or acrylic painting, where the paints essentially stay where they are put and
                    dry more or less in the form they are applied, water is an active and complex partner in the
                    watercolor painting process, changing both the absorbency and shape of the paper when it is wet 
                    and the outlines and appearance of the paint as it dries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many difficulties occur because watercolor paints do not have high hiding power, so previous efforts
                    cannot simply be painted over; and the paper support is both absorbent and delicate, so the paints
                    cannot simply be scraped off, like oil paint from a canvas, but must be laboriously
                    (and often only partially) lifted by rewetting and blotting. Watercolor has a longstanding
                    association with drawing or engraving, and the common procedure to curtail such mistakes is to make a 
                    precise, faint outline drawing in pencil of the subject to be painted, to use small brushes, and to paint
                    limited areas of the painting only after all adjacent paint areas have completely dried.              
                </p>

            <div class="page-content" id="pagination-content-2">
                <p>
                    Another characteristic of watercolor paints is that the carbohydrate binder is only a small
                    proportion of the raw paint volume, and much of the binder is drawn between the hydrophilic cellulose
                    fibers of wet paper as the paint (and paper) dries. As a result, watercolor paints do not form an enclosing
                    layer of vehicle around the pigment particles and a continuous film of dried vehicle over the painting
                    support, but leave pigment particles scattered and stranded like tiny grains of sand on the paper.
                    This increases the scattering of light from both the pigment and paper surfaces, causing a characteristic
                    whitening or lightening of the paint color as it dries. The exposed pigment particles are also vulnerable
                    to damaging ultraviolet light, which can compromise pigment permanency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Watercolor paint is traditionally and still commonly applied with brushes,
                    but modern painters have experimented with many other implements, particularly sprayers, scrapers,
                    sponges or sticks, and have combined watercolors with pencil, charcoal, crayon, chalk, ink, engraving,
                    monotype, lithography and collage, or with acrylic paint.

                <p>
                    Many watercolor painters, perhaps uniquely among all modern visual artists, still adhere to prejudices
                    dating from the 19th century rivalry between "transparent" and bodycolor painters. Among these are
                    injunctions never to use white paint, never to use black paint, only to use transparent color, or only
                    to work with "primary" color mixtures. In fact, many superb paintings flout some or all of these guidelines,
                    and they have little relevance to modern painting practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps only with the exception of egg tempera, watercolor is the painting medium that artists most
                    often compound themselves, by hand, using raw pigment and paint ingredients purchased from retail suppliers
                    and prepared using only kitchen utensils. Even with commercially prepared paints, watercolor is prized
                    for its nontoxic, tap ready solvent; lack of odor or flammability; prompt drying time; ease of cleanup
                    and disposal; long shelf life; independence from accessory equipment (jars, rags, easels, stretchers, etc.).
                    Its portability makes it ideal for plein air painting, and painters today can buy compact watercolor
                    kits—containing a dozen or more pan paints, collapsible brushes, water flask, brush rinsing cup and fold
                    out mixing trays—that fit neatly into a coat pocket.

    <h3>Experiment Description</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
        In this experiment, I have implemented the concept of pagination using javascript and jQuery.
        For every page, I hide/show the respective divs based on the selected page. When the document is ready, the content
        on the first page is loaded.
    </p>
    <br />
