            <p>
                Madhubani painting originated in a small village, known as Maithili,
                of the Bihar state of India. Initially, the womenfolk of the village
                drew the paintings on the walls of their home, as an illustration of
                their thoughts, hopes and dreams. With time, the paintings started
                becoming a part of festivities and special events, like marriage.

                Miniatures paintings are beautiful handmade paintings, which are quite
                colorful but small in size. The highlight of these paintings is the intricate
                and delicate brushwork, which lends them a unique identity.

                Mysore Painting is a form of classical South Indian painting, which evolved
                in the Mysore city of Karnataka. During that time, Mysore was under the reign
                of the Wodeyars and it was under their patronage that this school of painting
                reached its zenith.

                Pahari painting is the name given to Rajput paintings, made in the in the
                Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir states of India. These painting developed
                as well as flourished during the period of 17th to 19th century. Indian Pahadi

        <h4>Rajput Painting</h4>
        <div>
            <img src="https://ssubbanna.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dsc_0990-2z4gprus4cu80kwg880gwww0o-emn5ezj22k0s0g4k0sgk4cos4-th.jpg" class="picture">

                Rajput painting originated in the royal states of Rajasthan, somewhere around
                the late 16th and early 17th century. The Mughals ruled almost all the princely
                states of Rajasthan at that time and because of this; most of the schools of
                Rajput Painting in India reflect strong Mughal influence.

                Tanjore Painting is one of the most popular forms of classical South Indian painting.
                It is the native art form of Thanjavur (also known as Tanjore) city of Tamil Nadu.
                The dense composition, surface richness and vibrant colors of Indian Thanjavur Paintings
                distinguish them from the other types of paintings.

    <h4>Experiment description</h4>
    <hr />
    <p class="exp-desc">
        In this experiment I have implemented the accordion widget using jQuery.
        Accordion Widget in jQueryUI is a jQuery based expandable and collapsible
        content holder that is broken into sections and probably looks like tabs.
        jQueryUI provides accordion() method to achieve this.
