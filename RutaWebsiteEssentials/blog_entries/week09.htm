<h3>Week 09</h3>
<p>
    Hello everyone!!
    This week I have used Artsy API to fetch data about artworks by following the next links.
    In this experiment I have displayed all the paintings that will be for a particlar 'gene' in this case,
    it it 16th Century Art. The url gives upto 5 artworks and their description on any particular page.
    A next link on the current json redirects to the next json which also consists of 5 artworks. This continues recursively.
    Hence, to fetch all concurrent artwork, I have used callbacks to the next link recursively (max upto 5 callbacks).
    In this way, I load upto 25 artworks i.e 5 jsons including the first.
    I have also tried to assign event handlers to dynamically created DOM elements.
    However, this has not been implemented in this experiment yet.
