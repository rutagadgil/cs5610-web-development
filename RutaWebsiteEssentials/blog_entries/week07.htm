<h3>Week 07</h3>
<p>
    Hello everyone!!
    This week I have used a Places API to retrieve places (especially art museums) nearby users current location.
    This will be a part of my final. So initially, I have retrieved all places nearby from Places API.
    The next experiment is a variation of this experiment. It retrieves all musuems near the users location
    and shows them on a map using geolocation.
    I have also done an experiment on jQuery selectors that I am planning to use in my project.

    I am planning to work on a project for famous artists and their artwork. For this I will be using 'Artsy API'.

    Stay tuned for more project details!!
