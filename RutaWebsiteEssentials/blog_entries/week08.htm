<h3>Week 07</h3>
<p>
    Hello everyone!!
    This week I have used Artsy API to fetch data about artists and artworks about these artists.
    This will be a part of my final project. So initially, I have retrieved search criteria pertaining to
    Artists, Artworks, Show, Gene and Profile.
    The next experiment focuses on a single artist and the artworks related to this artist.
