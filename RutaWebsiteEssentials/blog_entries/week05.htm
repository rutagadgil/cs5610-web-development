<h3>Week 05</h3>
<p>
    This is my week 5 blog.
    In this week I have implemented experiment to extract RSS Feed data and display 
    only relevant data in my experiment.
    I have also performed an experiment using Google Books API where a user can search for a
    particular book by using query parameters.
    Another experiment that I have performed is on jQuery binding and unbinding where we can
    couple or decouple an elements' event handler.
