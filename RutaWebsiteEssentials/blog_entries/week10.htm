<h3>Week 10</h3>
<p>
    Hello everyone!!
    This week I have designed the Home Page and the About Page of my Final Project.
    I have used the experiment on navigation bar from week 2 for both pages.
    Also, I have used an image slideshow for my home page which has some of my paintings 
    (not downloaded form the internet. Hence the images exist in iamges folder).
    The Menu functionality is still under development.
    I have also worked on my last weeks' experiment and completed it by adding event
    handlers for dynamically created DOM elements.
