<h3>Week 06</h3>
<p>
    Hello everyone!!
    In this week I have implemented an experiment on JSON Parsing of internal data using the JSON.parse() function
    which can be used to convert a JSON text into a JavaScript object.
    I have also performed an experiment to disable the back button functionality.
    This is very beneficial for security purposes and I am planning to include it in my project.
    I have also tried to establish database connectivity.
    I could connect to the SQL Server through Management Studio and have created a table in my database.
    However, I was unable to update the connection strings properly.
    So I will be working on this experiment in the next week as well.
