<h3>Week 04</h3>
<p>
    Welcome to my blog for the forth week.
    In this week I have implemented dynamic CSS. Using this, we can change the appearence of elements at runtime.
    I have also implemented dynamic tables where we can add rows to the table at runtime. 
    We can also perform validations to manage the table entries in the javascript.
    Another experiment  is about jQuery AJAX, where I have pulled data from some of my previous experiments.
    In the last experiment, I have used the Google Feed API to extract latest news from BBC News and CNN News. The data is extracted from the RSS feed.
    As soon as the RSS feed is updated, the news on my website is also updated.
