<h3>HTML and CSS experiments</h3>

<p>
    Hey there!! This is my first blog. In this blog I have enlisted all the experiments that I
    have implemented using HTML and CSS.
    <br />
    In the first experiment I have implemented basic HTML input tags such as date, text(normal text, password), number and color.
    <br />
    In the second experiment, I have implemented simple CSS animation which can be used to change the style of an element.
    <br />
    The third experiment implements a Navigation Bar with submenus. The implementation is done using CSS.
    <br />
    In the fourth experiment, I have implemented an Accordion using jQuery. An accordion is an explandable and collapsible
    content holder used to contain large content on a page.
    <br />
    In the fifth experiment, I have implemented an Image Gallery slideshow. It is implemented using the z-index property of CSS.
    It also requires jQuery UI.
