<h3>Week 02</h3>
<p>
    In week 2, I have intially set up an icon for my website.
    I have also implemented an experiment on iFrames as a continuation to last weeks navigation bar. 
    In the jQuery experiment on sliding div, I learnt about the toggle functions offered by jQuery.
    Later, I worked on how to make pages responsive using CSS. Here the entire page content is split
    into 3 columns with images. In the next experiment, I have tried to work with basic SVG in HTML5.
    I have used the LinearGradient and RadialGradient to give effects to SVG objects.
